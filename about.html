        <p class="para"> Hello world !
I am Kélio Boutefnouchet, an artist-designer student. <br>
Passionate about exploring the connections between music, design, and both visual and digital arts. My path, first rooted in graphic design and music, shaped a 
sensitive and visual approach. Today, I work by combining music, digital design, and scenography, linking my rural and digital roots to address contemporary 
societal issues through my creations.

        <p class="subtitle">SKILLS & INTERESTS</p>
        <p class="para"> Coming from a background in graphic communication
design and music production, I now focus on digital
design as a space for experimentation and immersion.
Installations and interactive devices allow me to move
beyond the virtual, grounding my projects in tangible,
shared experiences.
At the same time, editorial design remains essential to
my practice. I see it as a way to capture ideas and give
projects lasting materiality. My particular interest in fine
art books allows me to push the limits of print, creating
visual and sensory reading experiences while preserving
traditional craftsmanship.
Total art, the fusion of disciplines, shapes my approach.
Digital media and print complement one another: one
opens immersive pathways, the other preserves and

transmits. I maintain a strong connection with my gene-
ration, and through these mediums, I aim to honor it by

building its memory, creating a living archive of our col-
lective experiences and ideas.

Alongside this, I produce, mix, and perform my own mu-
sic while exploring the ecosystem of concerts and live
events. I also practice hiking and trekking, and I am in-
terested in science communication as a way to better un-
derstand and share the world around us :).</p>
        <p class="para"> Beyond my artistic interests, I am into athletism (sprint), hiking, trekking and have an
            interest in sciences.</p>
