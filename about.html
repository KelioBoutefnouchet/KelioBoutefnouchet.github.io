        <p class="para"> Hello world !
I am Kélio Boutefnouchet, an artist-designer student. <br>
Passionate about exploring the connections between music, design, and both visual and digital arts. My path, first rooted in graphic design and music, shaped a sensitive and visual approach. Today, I work by combining music, digital design, and scenography, linking my rural and digital roots to address contemporary societal issues through my creations.

        <p class="para"> Graphic design occupies a significant part of my daily life, as this discipline is undeniably essential to my routine. I apply it both by creating visual universes for other musicians and for my own projects. At the same time, I produce, mix, and perform my musical compositions, burn CDs, and take a close interest in the ecosystem of concerts and event planning.
        I am also deeply involved in packaging, editorial design, and typography. I have a particular passion for creating collections of art and books centered around visual and musical artistic projects, aiming to push the boundaries of printed objects and deliver immersive reading experiences.
        Beyond my artistic pursuits, I enjoy hiking and trekking, and I have a keen interest in science communication and popularization</p>
        <p class="para"> To broaden my horizons, I travel whenever possible to meet people who have a different
            perspective and culture to get a more comprehensive understanding of the world around me.</p>
        <p class="para"> Simultaneously, I am self-taught in 3D modeling.</p>
        <p class="para"> Beyond my artistic interests, I am into athletism (sprint), hiking, trekking and have an
            interest in sciences.</p>
