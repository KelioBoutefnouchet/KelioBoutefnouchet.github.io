                ➔ Mikkae is a project designed to go beyond the language barrier. Knowing that the audience might not necessarily understand texts in French, I rethought my musical production so that it could function more autonomously than usual. The balance between sound textures, structures, and atmospheres was carefully crafted to convey emotions without relying solely on the lyrics. However, the texts remain essential: they narrate a pivotal moment in my life, marked by the disruption of my routine since the beginning of my internship in Japan. <br>

This musical project brings together four original tracks, performed during the third edition of the “Réunion Secrète” at Sapporo City University. Invited by a colleague who had discovered and appreciated my music, I had the opportunity to perform as part of Mikkae, a festival organized twice a year within the university. This event, dedicated to student musical experimentation, offers a space for free and immersive creation.<br>

The idea behind Mikkae was to extend this performance by giving it a tangible form, making it concrete and distributable as a complete project: from creating the cover art to pressing the CD, including Spotify canvases and promotional content. To further enrich the listener experience, I also expanded the project’s visual universe into a line of merchandise, creating a stronger link between sound and image.<br>
